    *Group Projects*

    Group Projects can be found at the end of the following sections:

    • OO Ruby
    • Sinatra
    • Rails
    • Rails/Jquery

    They are a great way to help solidfy the knowsledge youve gained from the section, as well as give you a chance to work with people as a team on an app!

    You can join the following channel and check if anyone else has been looking for a team for the same project as you.  Likewise, you can post that you are looking team up in the channel as well, just make sure you specify the project!
